# Spaghetti

A CyberChef-like tool built with React Flow for visual node-based data processing. Designed for quick and dirty experimentation and exploration, making it perfect for learning and educational purposes. Can be easily embedded into websites, blogs, tutorials, and documentation.

Named "Spaghetti" after how easy it is to make node graph code look like spaghetti when building complex data processing pipelines.

## Features

- **Visual Node-Based Interface**: Build execution graphs using React Flow for intuitive data processing
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for learning and experimenting with data transformations
- **Embeddable**: Can be integrated into websites, blogs, tutorials, and documentation
- **Code Generation**: Export your data processing pipelines to various programming languages
- **Built-in Function Classes**: 
  - String manipulation
  - Binary data operations
  - Cryptography functions
  - JSON processing
  - Base64 encoding/decoding
  - JWT encoding/decoding
  - Compression algorithms
  - And more data transformation operations
- **User Experience**:
  - Command palette for quick actions (Ctrl/Cmd + K)
  - Search functionality
  - Share your graphs via URL
  - Function documentation viewer
- **Quick Experimentation**: Designed for rapid prototyping and exploration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavi2410/spaghetti
cd spaghetti
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Usage

1. Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + K) to add nodes to your graph
2. Connect nodes to create an execution flow
3. Input your data and click "Run" to process it
4. Share your graph using the "Share" button
